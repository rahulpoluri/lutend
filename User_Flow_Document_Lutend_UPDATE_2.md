User Flow Document for Lutend

This document explains how users move through the Lutend app, and covers some special cases that might happen along the way. 
The way users interact with the app is based on our values, assumptions, and lessons we've learned from looking at other dating apps and their problems. 
Problems We're Solving 
● Doom Swiping: No more endless profile browsing. We match users directly and help them set up virtual meetings at times that work for both. 
● Unrealistic Expectations: Users focus here on only a few users at a time, which makes it easy to connect without comparing hundreds of profiles at once and choosing among them. Avoiding decision paralysis. 
● Superficiality: Because meetings are virtual and blind, users don't need to focus on how they write their profile and what photos they upload. They just have to be themselves. 
● High Cost Without Results: Users only pay when they actually meet a match. Simple and fair. 
● Ghosting: There’s no chatting or texting before the meeting, so no ghosting or waiting for replies. 
● Gender Ratio Issues: We make sure everyone gets timely matches or their money back. 
● Fake Profiles: We ask for government ID and video proof to make sure profiles are real. 
● Harassment or Misuse: Meetings are recorded and stored securely on the user's phone. If someone reports bad behavior, we can review the logs. If the complaint is valid, we take action. 
● Support: We give tips to help users make a good impression and offer solid technical support. 

Main User Flow 
Imagine two people using the app: User1 and User2. We keep the experience neutral for all genders. 
1. Signing Up: ○ User1 signs up by answering some questions and completing ID and video verification. 
○ Update 1: User 1 is shown with virtual avatars from his photos which he can choose, which will be used to share his bio to other Users for matching anonymously. 
○ Update 2: There is a regenerate button which can be used only once, where the user can recreate the 3 more avatars. So in the end he will have total 6 avatars to choose from 
○ Once verified and checked, User1 is taken to their dashboard. 

2. Getting Started: ○ A quick tutorial shows User1 how the app works by pointing out buttons and tabs. 

3. Setting Preferences (Optional): ○ User1 can change their match preferences from set defaults and re-order to prioritize preference more, if they want. This step is recommended for users. 

4. Writing a Bio (Optional): ○ User1 can write a short anonymous note for potential matches. If they skip this, we add a default message. Update 1: User1 can also add {three} generalised questions to ask his match with the profile to intrigue the interest in each other. These questions will be sent with his bio to his match User2. 

5. Start Finding Matches: ○ User1 goes to the Meeting tab and taps “Start Finding Matches.” Update 1: User1 can do parallely three searches. But he can start the next search after he confirms and schedules a meeting with the first one, while he is waiting or in later stages, he can start the search again, maximum triggering {three} searches in parallel. 



○ Matches are not instant. The app sends a notification when a match is found. 

6. Match Found: ○ When User1 gets a match, they have a {few hours} to respond. 
○ Inside the Matches tab, User1 sees User2’s anonymous bio and some basic info. User2 sees the same for User1. No photos are shown. Update 1: the profile is shown with their avatar which he created while onboarding instead of their photo 

7. Choosing a Time to Meet: ○ Update 1: After the User1 checks the profile, if he finds it interesting, he can send a personalized voice note to his match (optional) and answer the questions given by his match (optional). 
○ If User1 likes the match, they accept and suggest times to meet during the coming week. Update 1: this will be sent to User2 along with answers and chosen timeslots. 
○ User2 can pick a time from those or suggest new ones Update 1: User2 can answer the question and also send a voice note to User1 (optional). 
○ If User1 agrees to the new time, the meeting is scheduled. If not, User1 can reject and start over. 
○ The person who replies first gets to suggest the first time slots. 

8. Waiting for the Meeting: ○ Both users wait until their meeting time. We send helpful reminders and checklists so they can prepare. Update 1: Users can also start one more match search while they are waiting. 

9. Meeting Confirmation (Optional): ○ A few hours before the meeting, we ask both users to confirm they’re joining. Or they can send a short message by pressing cancel if something comes up but that will be penalised. 

10. Joining the Meeting: ○ When it's time, users can join the meeting from the Meeting tab. 
○ Meetings last 30 minutes by default. 
○ If both want more time, they can extend the meeting. It can go on for a {few hours} if both agree and extend every 30 minutes. 



○ If someone disconnects because of a tech issue, the other person is asked to wait for 10 minutes so they can come back. 


11. Giving Feedback: 

● After the meeting ends, both users must fill out a feedback form. 
● They can say what went well or what didn’t. 
● They can also choose what they want to do next: ○ Reveal their details to the other person 
○ Update 1: Enable chat: An option which is enabled for {7 days 30 days} with ghosting time of 7 days. 
○ Set up another virtual meeting 
○ Plan a real-life date 
○ Reject the match 
○ Report the match 


12. What Happens Next: 

○ If both choose to reveal details, they can see each other's contact info. 
○ Update 1: If both choose to enable chat, they can see each other's profile details along with their own feedback and can chat with them, but this is active only for {7days 30 days} (this creates urgency to move forward) Update 2: with ghosting time of {max 7} days meaning if one or both does not have any message in last {7} days chat will expire in this time they can part ways or share their contact details in chat so that they switch to other means of communication or plan a meet in person.. 
○ If one chooses to meet again, the other is notified and can accept to plan a second meeting. 
○ If both choose to plan a real date, they get help with that. 
○ If one rejects, the other gets a polite message after a cooling period of {12 hours} and is sent back to find another match. 
○ If someone reports the other person with the meeting log, we review it. If the report is true, we may ban or warn the user. 
○ We show one user’s decision to the other only after a short delay. This gives them time to think things through. 


13. Match Credits: 

○ The first match is free. 



○ After that, users need to buy credits to get more matches. 


Special Situations 
a. What if no one replies to a match notification? 
● If no one replies in time (or just one person does), the match is dropped. 
● The person who replied is sent to find another match. 
● The other person’s match finder is paused and they are told to turn it on again when ready. No one is penalized. 

b. How long before a match offer expires? 
● Users should respond (either by accepting or suggesting a time) within the {same day}. After that, the match will be canceled. 

Can users reconnect with the same match? 
● Yes, if both want to. But if one person rejects the match, they can’t be matched again. 

c. Do users need to confirm the meeting? 
● Confirmation is optional. It helps the other person feel confident. 
● If someone doesn’t confirm but still shows up, that’s okay. 
● If someone doesn’t show up or cancel, they lose one credit. The other person gets one extra credit. 

When should users confirm? 
● There's no strict rule, but {same-day} confirmation is preferred. 

Credits and Refunds 
How many credits for a match? 

● One credit per new match. Users can meet the same match multiple times without using new credits, as long as they haven’t shared personal details yet. 

Do credits expire? 
● No. Credits stay in your account. If someone doesn’t get a match for {6 months}, they can ask for a refund. 

What if a match is canceled? 
● If the match is canceled before the meeting time is confirmed, no one loses credits. 
● If a meeting is set and one person doesn’t show up or cancels, that person loses a credit and the other gets one extra.
